# FindGLFW
# ----------
#
# Try to find GLFW
#
# IMPORTED Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target ``GLFW::GLFW``, if
# GLFW has been found.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines the following variables::
#
#   GLFW_FOUND           - True if GLFW was found
#   GLFW_INCLUDE_DIRS    - include directories for GLFW and third-party GLFW-Hpp
#   GLFW_LIBRARIES       - link against this library to use GLFW
#
# The module will also define the following cache variables::
#
#   GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR     - the GLFW include directory
#   GLFW_Hpp_INCLUDE_DIR - the GLFW-Hpp include directory
#   GLFW_LIBRARY         - the path to the GLFW library
#

# GLFW header file
find_path(GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR
  NAMES GLFW/glfw3.h
  PATHS
    "$ENV{GLFW_SDK}/include"
  )

# GLFW library
find_library(GLFW_LIBRARY
    NAMES glfw3 glfw
    PATHS
    "$ENV{GLFW_SDK}/lib")

set(GLFW_LIBRARIES ${GLFW_LIBRARY})
set(GLFW_INCLUDE_DIRS ${GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR})

include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
find_package_handle_standard_args(GLFW
  DEFAULT_MSG
  GLFW_LIBRARY GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR)

# mark_as_advanced(GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR GLFW_LIBRARY)

if(GLFW_FOUND AND NOT TARGET GLFW::GLFW)
  add_library(GLFW::GLFW UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
  set_target_properties(GLFW::GLFW PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_LOCATION "${GLFW_LIBRARIES}"
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${GLFW_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
endif()
